# Senior Project - PC Part Web Shop

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project was created because I have a passion for building computer parts and I thought a web shop would be a great way to marry my enjoyment of programming with buying parts for building computers, and also being able to share that with others. The project was created utilizing the MVC design pattern and utilizes JavaEE (SE8), and runs on a Wildfly 11 server.
