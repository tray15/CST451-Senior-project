					<p>Computers are our passion here at PC Parts Online. Browse
						our inventory and find the parts to build the machine of your
						dreams. All products are sold at MSRP or lower. We take our
						passion for the hobby serious and require every user to have an
						account in order to make a purchase, or to browse the wares.</p>
					<p>This shop was started in order to help people get the parts
						that they want. Due to the COVID-19 supply chain issues, many
						people took advantage of it by purchasing the hardware at normal
						prices, then would sell them third-party for a profit. After
						seeing this happen for many months, we decided to open our own
						shop to help others make the machine that they always wanted, and
						at a fair price.</p>
